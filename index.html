                I am working on developing and using Responsive Design on current projects. There are multiple applications for such a nifty tool esp, with some break points thown in!

                I was born and raised in California and still haven't lived anywhere else, yet. Although, I have been lucky enough to have a big enough state to move around, I really enjoy travelling. I have been lucky to have had as many experiences with other cultures and hope to see more as time goes on.

                I love reading and organizing. Unsurprisingly, I chose history for my major and was very happy with the content and critical thinking. I haven't brushed up on my old papers in a while but, still enjoy the application of knowledge wherever I am. Plus, it is supprising how often research and organization can accomplish.

                My little man is a 1 year old "mini" australian shepard poodle mix. He is a fluff-monster and loves to snuggle ... once you can tire him out. When I am not learning more about programming and working, my boyfriend and I are mostly just trying to keep up with him.
